# DSAgt Demo: Tokamak Stability

> **Estimated time:** involved / not a 10-minute demo. Setup is the cost:
> building the **fusion-io** C/C++ library from source (scripted, but its
> compilers and libraries must be installed first). Budget roughly an hour
> for first-time setup; the agent session itself is ~15 minutes once the
> dependencies and data are in place.

This guide uses DSAgt to investigate the stability properties of a tokamak
configuration from linear MHD simulation output produced by the
[M3D-C1](https://sites.google.com/pppl.gov/m3d-c1) unstructured-mesh
finite-element code. The Python modules under [`scripts/`](scripts/) — `hdf5.py`,
`m3dc1_tools.py`, `m3dc1_plots.py`, and the `m3dc1/` wrapper package — provide
the functions for reading M3D-C1 HDF5 output, evaluating fields from their
basis-function coefficients, computing equilibrium and spectral quantities, and
plotting. The agent registers those functions as codes under the guidance of
the [`m3dc1-skill`](skills/m3dc1-skill/SKILL.md), which documents the APIs and
the conventions the codes must follow.

The example dataset, a single M3D-C1 simulation output, is courtesy of Alvaro
Sanchez-Villar (PPPL). The session below has been tested with Claude Code.

## Prerequisites

- DSAgt installed with the `tokamak-stability` extra
  (`pip install "dsagt[tokamak-stability] @ git+https://github.com/AI-ModCon/dsagt.git"`),
  which brings `h5py` and `matplotlib`; `numpy` comes with dsagt.
- An agent platform installed and **already authenticated**.
- The [fusion-io](https://github.com/nferraro/fusion-io) library and its Python
  bindings, built from source by `scripts/setup_env.sh` in the walkthrough's
  bundle (the DSAgt use-case data folder,
  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RWQAJeHaikIaD7CCf8ciJ71m55S1erp6):

  ```bash
  curl -L "https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1qo-ZG_GoGlZ_X2BjR1fE8zZW3s9K6mTu&export=download&confirm=t" \
    -o tokamak_stability.tar.gz
  mkdir -p tokamak_bundle && tar xzf tokamak_stability.tar.gz -C tokamak_bundle ./scripts/setup_env.sh
  bash tokamak_bundle/scripts/setup_env.sh
  ```

  The build needs git, cmake, pkg-config, C/C++/Fortran compilers, MPI, HDF5,
  NetCDF, and LAPACK already installed (macOS: `brew install cmake pkgconf gcc
  open-mpi hdf5 netcdf`; Debian: `apt install cmake pkg-config gfortran
  libopenmpi-dev libhdf5-dev libnetcdf-dev liblapack-dev`); the
  script names whatever is missing and stops. It installs under
  `~/dsagt-projects/.tools/tokamak_stability/fusion-io/` and prints the
  `FIO_INSTALL_DIR`, `PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`, and library-path exports to add to
  your shell before starting the session. The build is bound to the Python
  that ran the script; after switching to another Python, run the script again.


## Setup

```bash
dsagt init
```

At the menu, name the project `tokamak-stability` and pick your agent; the
defaults are fine for the rest. Then:

```bash
PROJ=~/dsagt-projects/tokamak-stability
# The bundle downloaded under Prerequisites: one M3D-C1 simulation output
# (data/m3dc1_data), the modules with the m3dc1 package and their tests (scripts/),
# and the m3dc1 skill (skills/).
tar xzf tokamak_stability.tar.gz -C "$PROJ"
export PYTHONPATH=$PROJ/scripts:$PYTHONPATH
export M3DC1_DATA_DIR=$PROJ/data/m3dc1_data
python -m pytest "$PROJ/scripts/tests" -q -p no:cacheprovider   # all 91 pass with fusion-io and the data in place; several minutes
dsagt start tokamak-stability                  # mirrors the skill into the agent's native skills dir
```

The integration tests need fusion-io and the data directory named by
`M3DC1_DATA_DIR`; failures naming `fpy` or `write_neo_input` mean the
fusion-io install is not on the path. The tests write `__pycache__` directories
under `scripts/`; `-p no:cacheprovider` keeps `.pytest_cache` out of the
current directory. `dsagt start` mirrors the copied skill
into the agent's native skills directory; if you start the agent directly
instead, run `dsagt init` on the project once more first.

## Execution

Paste these prompts one at a time. Plots go to `plots/` and new data products
to `processed_data/` under the project directory by default; the skill tells the
agent so, and you can redirect either in a prompt.

### 1. Register the M3D-C1 functions as codes

```text
The directory scripts/ contains three Python modules with functions for
M3D-C1 HDF5 datasets — hdf5.py, m3dc1_tools.py, and m3dc1_plots.py — plus the
m3dc1 wrapper package they use. Before using or registering any of them, read
the m3dc1-skill (skills/m3dc1-skill/SKILL.md) and its references for the
calling conventions, input/output formats, and examples. Then register the
functions as codes and print a summary here.
```

Creating and registering the codes may take several minutes. **Verify:**
`Search the registry for M3D-C1 codes.` The skill requires that codes wrapping
functions that call into fusion-io write their JSON result to an
`--output-json` file rather than stdout; check one such spec (for example the
Miller-geometry code) carries that option.

### 2. Explore the dataset

```text
Using your codes, tell me about the data in data/m3dc1_data/.
```

**Expect:** case metadata, the available time snapshots, and the scalar traces,
read through the registered codes (with `dsagt-run` records in `trace_archive/`).

### 3. Equilibrium quantities

```text
What are the Miller parameters for this configuration?
```

```text
What's the safety factor profile: q on axis, q95, and q at the edge?
```

**Expect:** the agent runs the Miller-geometry and q-profile codes and reports
the parameters and the three q values: R0 1.819 m, a 0.559 m, κ 1.589, δ 0.299;
q0 1.10, q95 5.03, q_edge 6.72. q95 comes from the `compute_q95` code applied
to the `q` entry the `compute_flux_average_profiles` code wrote; the profile
value at the grid point nearest 0.95 is 5.05, which is what reading the profile
by eye gives.

### 4. Field plots

```text
Make plots of the t=1 fields of the electron temperature, all components of the
current density, and the perturbations of the density and magnetic flux.
```

**Expect:** PNG files under `plots/`, produced by evaluating the fields on a
grid rather than plotting raw coefficients (the skill says which the user means),
through the registered `plot_field` and `plot_perturbed_field_map` codes, one
record per plot.

### 5. Spectra and energy trace

```text
Create plots of the standard poloidal spectra and the kinetic energy trace.
```

**Expect:** two PNG files under `plots/`, `standard_spectra_t1.png` from the
standard-spectra plot code and `kinetic_energy.png` from the kinetic-energy
plot code, each with a record.

### 6. Repackage secondary data products

```text
Save the poloidal spectral data for the pressure field in an HDF5 file
processed_data/pressure_spectrum.h5.
```

```text
Extract the electron temperature and electron density data at t=1 and place
them in an HDF5 file processed_data/electrons.h5.
```

**Expect:** both files under `processed_data/`, written by registered codes
(the agent registers a spectrum-computing code for the first if none exists,
and uses the grid-evaluation code for the second), with the evaluated field
values rather than basis coefficients.

### 7. Reconstruct the session as a rerunnable script

```text
Reconstruct the pipeline from the execution records as a bash script and save
it as dsagt_session_script.sh. Then change only the data-directory path into a
variable at the top so it can be rerun on other M3D-C1 datasets.
```

**Expect:** `reconstruct_pipeline` renders the `trace_archive/` records in the
order they ran, including any run that failed, and saves the script at the path
given; the agent's only edit is the variable. The script starts by creating the
directories the recorded outputs go to (`plots/`, `processed_data/tmp/`), so it
runs on a fresh copy of the project. The skill asks the agent to check your
default shell first, since the fusion-io environment variables may be set only
in that shell's startup files.

### 8. Review the project artifacts

```text
Reply with a tree listing of my project folder, with the artifacts dsagt recorded during this session marked and one line on what each marked item is.
```

**Expect:** a tree of the project directory in the reply that marks the execution
records in `trace_archive/`, the reports in `audit/`, the registered codes and
installed skills under `skills/`, the trace store `mlflow.db`, and the session's
outputs, with a line on what each is.

## Post-Conditions

1. Code registry contains specs for the M3D-C1 reading, analysis, plotting, and
   HDF5 repackaging functions; those wrapping fusion-io calls take `--output-json`.
2. `plots/` holds the field, spectrum, and energy-trace plots.
3. `processed_data/` holds `pressure_spectrum.h5` and `electrons.h5`.
4. `trace_archive/` holds one execution record per code run, and no stray
   temporary JSON files remain in the project.
5. `dsagt_session_script.sh` reruns the session against a data directory set at
   the top of the script.
6. MLflow traces (in the serverless `mlflow.db` store) capture every code
   execution and agent turn — `dsagt traces tokamak-stability`.

## What This Tests

| DSAgt Capability | Steps |
|------------------|-------|
| Module tests as an environment check before the session | Setup |
| Skill-guided code creation from Python modules | 1 |
| Registry search | 1 |
| Code execution with provenance through `dsagt-run` | 2–6 |
| Handling codes whose stdout is unusable (file-based JSON results) | 1, 3 |
| Plot and data-product generation into project subdirectories | 4–6 |
| Pipeline reconstruction with a parameterized input | 7 |
| Review of the session's artifacts | 8 |

## Cleanup

```bash
dsagt rm tokamak-stability -y
rm -r tokamak_stability.tar.gz tokamak_bundle
rm -rf ~/dsagt-projects/.tools/tokamak_stability      # the fusion-io build
```
