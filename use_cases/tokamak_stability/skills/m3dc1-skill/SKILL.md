## Creating CLI codes from M3D-C1 python modules

Always read the relevant API guide before creating CLI codes --- see the `Reference material` section below.


IMPORTANT NOTE FOR AGENTS GENERATING NEW CODES FROM m3dc1_tools.py
------------------------------------------------------------------
The functions marked "requires m3dc1 + fpy" in the initial comment
in `m3dc1_tools.py` call into compiled C/Fortran code that writes diagnostic 
messages (e.g. "deleting simulation object", "period = 6.28318") directly 
to the OS-level stdout file descriptor. This output bypasses Python's 
sys.stdout entirely and cannot be suppressed or redirected from Python.

Consequence: any CLI code that (1) calls one of these functions and (2) prints
its JSON result to stdout will produce contaminated output that cannot be parsed
as JSON when captured via shell redirect.

Required pattern for any new CLI code wrapping these functions:
    - Accept an --output-json FILE argument.
    - Write the JSON result to that file instead of printing to stdout.
    - Document in the code spec that the agent MUST use --output-json and read
      from the file rather than capturing stdout.

Functions that ARE affected:
    `compute_flux_average_profiles`, `compute_miller_geometry`,
    `compute_perturbed_fields`, `compute_poloidal_spectrum`, `compute_standard_spectra`
    `evaluate_field_on_grid`

Functions NOT affected (h5py / numpy only — no compiled stdout writes):
    `read_c1input`, `list_time_snapshots`, `read_snapshot_time`, `read_scalar_traces`,
    `read_case_metadata`, `read_mesh_vertices`, `make_evaluation_grid`,
    `compute_ke_growth_trace`, `compute_growth_rate`, `compute_q95`

Every function above becomes its own code, including `compute_q95`: q95 is
obtained by passing the `q` entry of the JSON file the `compute_flux_average_profiles`
code wrote (`{"psi_norm": [...], "profile": [...]}`, layout in
`references/m3dc1_tools_api.md`) to the `compute_q95` code, never by reading the
profile and estimating it. Pass `case_dir` as an absolute path.

The same rule holds for `m3dc1_plots.py`: every public plotting function in
`references/m3dc1_plots_api.md` becomes its own code, and a plot is made by
running that code, never by importing the module from a script. A request for
plots of fields at a time index uses the `plot_field` code (a field or a
component of one at a snapshot) and the `plot_perturbed_field_map` code (the
difference between a snapshot and the equilibrium). Plot codes take an
`--output` path with `role: output` so the record names the PNG.


## When to use these codes

Always use the M3D-C1 codes when processing or investigating datasets created by this code. Only create custom codes when your needs cannot be met by any of the existing codes. Be watchful for synonyms of alternative expressions from those used in the tool descriptions; for example, use of `repackage_hdf5` should also be triggered by calls to repack or reorganize HDF5 data, or to create a new file to hold a new dataset etc.

When using any codes that write a temporary JSON file (to circumvent the corruption of stdout by fpy as described above), write it under the project directory (`processed_data/tmp/`), and delete it as soon as it is no longer needed to connect code calls. Do not leave unnecessary JSON files in the filesystem, and do not write them outside the project, where they cannot be read back or cleaned up.

If the user's meaning or intent is unclear always ask a clarifying question --- do not silently fail or say that a required code does not exist.


## Note on how M3D-C1 field data is stored

M3D-C1 stores fields using the coefficients of the basis functions rather than the pointwise field values themselves. The field values can be found using the `eval_field` function in the `m3dc1` python module; the `eval_field_on_grid` function in `m3dc1_tools.py` evaluates field values across a spatial grid and either returns a dict or writes an HDF5 file. Use these functions or codes derived from them to evaluate fields. If the user asks for field data (e.g. temperature, density, pressure, magnetic field or current density components) to be repackaged, repacked, extracted, moved, rewritten etc. assume that they are interested in these real evaluated field values rather than the raw coefficient values. Only repackage raw coefficients if the user specifically requests this. If the user's intent is unclear always ask a clarifying question.


## Where to store products

Unless explicitly requested by the user, products you create (e.g. plots or new files containing repacked or processed data) should be placed in the active dsagt project directory or its subdirectories. In particular, do not place any new files in the data directory in which the source M3D-C1 data files are located unless requested by the user. By default, place plots in a `plots/` subdirectory and new files containing data in a `processed_data/` subdirectory. A code creates the directory of its output path (`Path(output).parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`) before writing, so the first write into a new location succeeds without a shell `mkdir` outside the record.

If the user expresses a preference for new file locations attempt to maintain consistency with this choice for the remainder of the session unless new instructions are given; for example, if the user asks for a plot to go in a `new_images/` directory place subsequent plots in the same directory unless directed otherwise. If the user's intentions are unclear (e.g. plots have been placed in more the one directory in the same session) ask for clarification before proceeding.


## Generating shell scripts for session recreation

When asked to make a shell script always check the user's default shell. Create the script for the default shell unless the user requests a different shell, in which case ask for clarification. In particular, Mac users may informally ask for a "bash script" even if they have zsh set as their default shell. This may be a problem as environment variables required for finding libraries such as fusion-io may exist only in the default shell's dot files.


## Reference material

ALWAYS read the relevant API guide before attempting to create CLI codes from one of the python modules.

-  `references/m3dc1_tools_api.md`: API and usage guide to the functions in `m3dc1_tools.py`. These are mostly wrappers of the `m3dc1` python module.
