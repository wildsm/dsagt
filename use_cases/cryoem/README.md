# DSAgt Demo: Cryo-EM Data Curation Pipeline

> **Estimated time:** 12 to 25 minutes of session time. Setup downloads **~0.5 GB of
> data** (84 micrograph previews and the ground-truth particle tables), two
> open-access papers, and the CryoPPP repository, then ingests the repository into
> the knowledge base (minutes on the local embedder) before any pipeline work.

This guide documents a DSAgt demonstration using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data. It exercises knowledge ingestion, KB-guided pipeline design, code registration from third-party scripts, multi-stage pipeline execution with domain-specific evaluation, and the [AI-readiness check](../../docs/readiness.md): with the check on, the agent runs the AIDRIN quality baseline before and after the tabular curation step on its own, so the pipeline's AI-readiness gain is measured.

## Prerequisites

- DSAgt installed
- An agent platform installed and **already authenticated** (e.g., `claude` for Claude Code)
- Python 3.12 or later
- ~1 GB disk space for the cryo-EM test data and the CryoPPP repository
- Git installed

## Setup

### 1. Initialize a DSAgt project

```bash
dsagt init
```

At the menu, name the project `cryoem-pipeline`, pick your agent, and keep the defaults (the
AI-readiness check stays on). Then:

```bash
PROJ=~/dsagt-projects/cryoem-pipeline
```

### 2. Download the data, papers, and CryoPPP repository into the project

The agent runs with the project directory as its working directory, so everything it
reads goes under `$PROJ`.

```bash
mkdir -p "$PROJ/data/cryoem/papers" "$PROJ/repos"
curl -L https://calla.rnet.missouri.edu/cryoppp_lite/10017.tar.gz | tar xz -C "$PROJ/data/cryoem"
# CryoPPP paper: Dhakal et al., Scientific Data 2023 (open access)
curl -L https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02280-2.pdf -o "$PROJ/data/cryoem/papers/cryoppp_paper.pdf"
# CryoCRAB paper: Chen et al., Scientific Data 2025 (open access) — defines the 0-7 micrograph quality score
curl -L https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05179-2.pdf -o "$PROJ/data/cryoem/papers/cryocrab_paper.pdf"
git clone https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/cryoppp.git "$PROJ/repos/cryoppp"
```

The CryoPPP_Lite copy of the EMPIAR-10017 (β-galactosidase) subset holds 84 micrograph
previews as JPG and the ground-truth particle tables with real CTF/defocus columns and a
selected-vs-excluded curation split; the pipeline merges and then curates the tables, so every
data operation runs inside the session with provenance. The full-resolution micrographs
(~20 GB, `cryoppp/10017.tar.gz` on the same server) are not needed for this walkthrough.

### 3. Start the session

```bash
dsagt start cryoem-pipeline
```

## Execution

Paste these prompts one at a time. The agent runs the AI-readiness check around the tabular stages
without being told to. The derive, score, merge, and curate stages each read and write a CSV, so
the check covers all four; the micrograph previews are images and have no check.

### 1. Create a cryo-EM knowledge collection

```text
Ingest the folder repos/cryoppp/ into the knowledge base as a collection called "cryoppp".
```

Wait for the ingest job to complete, then:

```text
Append the files data/cryoem/papers/cryoppp_paper.pdf and data/cryoem/papers/cryocrab_paper.pdf
to the cryoppp collection.
```

**Verify:**

```text
List all knowledge base collections.
```

Should show `cryoppp`.

### 2. Query the knowledge base for pipeline design

```text
Search the cryoppp collection for guidance on creating an AI-ready data processing pipeline for cryo-EM micrographs. What quality parameters should I filter on, and what thresholds are recommended?
```

The agent should return chunks describing quality metrics: CTF resolution, defocus ranges, ice thickness thresholds, and motion statistics.

### 3. Register CryoPPP processing codes

```text
Register the two CryoPPP scripts convert_start_to_csv_file.py and
generate_box_files_for_each_micrographs.py from repos/cryoppp/ as codes. They have
hard-coded paths and no command-line interface, so wrap each in a small CLI script under
skills/<name>/scripts/ that takes its input and output paths as arguments.
```

**Verify:**

```text
Search the registry for cryo-EM codes.
```

### 4. Create a quality scoring code

```text
Write a Python script that scores cryo-EM micrographs based on:
- CTF fit resolution (CTFMaxRes)
- Defocus range
- Ice thickness
- Motion statistics

Use the CryoCRAB 0-7 scoring scheme from the CryoCRAB paper in the cryoppp collection: each of
its seven screening parameters within the dataset's 3-sigma interval contributes one point, and
scores map to tiers low (0-2), medium (3-5), high (6-7). Score on the parameters available in our
metadata. The script should read a metadata CSV and output a scored CSV with quality_score and
quality_tier columns. Save the script under skills/<name>/scripts/ and register it as a code.
```

The agent should search the knowledge base, write the script, and register it via `save_code_spec`.

### 5. Scan the dataset and derive per-micrograph metadata

```text
Run the pipeline on the EMPIAR-10017 dataset in data/cryoem/10017/. First, scan the directory
to understand what's there, then derive per-micrograph metadata from the selected ground-truth
particle table in data/cryoem/10017/ground_truth/ (defocus U, defocus V, and defocus angle per
particle, aggregated per micrograph) into data/cryoem/micrograph_metadata.csv, with a
registered code.
```

### 6. Score the micrographs

```text
Run the quality scoring code on that metadata.
```

### 7. Merge the particle tables

```text
Register a code that merges the two ground-truth particle tables in
data/cryoem/10017/ground_truth/ into data/cryoem/particles.csv, adding a selected flag
(1 for the selected table, 0 for excluded), and run it.
```

### 8. Curate the merged table

```text
Register a code that curates the merged table (keep only rows with selected == 1, drop the
selected column, write data/cryoem/particles_curated.csv), and run it.
```

### 9. Summarize the pipeline

```text
Summarize: how many micrographs fall into each quality tier, and did curation improve the
particle data?
```

The Lite archive carries no CTF-fit, motion, or ice-thickness columns, so the derived metadata
holds only the defocus parameters; the tier split depends on which derived columns the agent
scores. The measurable gain of this pipeline is in the particle tables.

The merge and the curation are the two data operations on the particle tables, so the prompt
asks for them as registered codes: each run is then an execution record, and the AI-readiness
check has a before and an after to measure. The merge has two input tables and no single
"before" file, so the check pairs are: `particles.csv` is the merge's after and the curation's
before, and `particles_curated.csv` is the curation's after. After each of these steps
`dsagt-run` notes the tables that have no readiness report, and the agent checks them with the
`aidrin` skill; each check's execution record holds the report. The two reports on the
particle tables carry the gain post-condition 4 is
judged on. Expected across the curation step:

| Metric | before → after | Reading |
|---|---|---|
| `completeness` (overall) | 1.0 → 1.0 | already complete |
| `duplicity` | 0.0 → 0.0 | no duplicate particles |
| `outliers` (overall) | **0.041 → 0.029** | curation removed ~30% of outliers |
| `class-imbalance` (Class Number, passthrough) | **22.2 → 11.1** | markedly more balanced |

A score is comparable only before and after one operation on the same table. Read in run
order, the reports seem to get worse and then recover, because they describe different
tables:

| Table | `outliers` | `class-imbalance` |
|---|---|---|
| selected particles (input) | 0.029 | 11.1 |
| excluded particles (input) | 0.038 | 10.2 |
| `micrograph_metadata.csv` (84 rows of per-micrograph statistics) | 0.075 | n/a |
| the scored micrograph CSV | 0.055 | n/a |
| `particles.csv` (merged) | 0.041 | 22.2 |
| `particles_curated.csv` | 0.029 | 11.1 |

The micrograph table scores highest because means, spreads, minima and maxima over 84 rows
have long tails; adding the score columns lowers the average without cleaning anything. The
merge joins two populations with different distributions and 22 more 2D classes, so the merged
table scores worse than either input. Curation returns the particle table to the selected
set's values. What the step shows is that the check measures the merge's effect and the
curation's removal of it: `outliers` (and `class-imbalance`, if the agent proposes it) move,
and `completeness` and `duplicity` confirm the data was structurally sound throughout. The
curated table is as AI-ready as the selected input, no more.

### 10. Generate a datacard

```text
Use the datacard-generator skill to write a Level 1 datacard for the curated cryo-EM data.
```

The skill asks its questions in batches: first which capabilities the card covers, then the
fields that identify the dataset. One answer covers them:

```text
Discoverability only. Name the dataset "EMPIAR-10017 curated particles". The contact is
Jane Doe, jane@example.org. There is no license yet. Take every other field from the data
and the two papers, mark what they do not give as unknown, and ask nothing further. When
the card is written, validate it with the skill's validator and fix what it reports.
```

### 11. Reconstruct the pipeline

```text
Reconstruct the pipeline from the execution records as a bash script and save it as pipeline.sh.
```

**Expect:** `reconstruct_pipeline` with `output="pipeline.sh"` saves the script into the
project and returns it; the recorded runs appear in the order they ran, with a failed run kept
as a comment.

### 12. Review the project artifacts

```text
Show me the contents of my project folder in a tree format, with the artifacts dsagt recorded during this session highlighted.
```

**Expect:** a listing of the project directory that marks the execution records in
`trace_archive/` (the readiness reports are the `aidrin` records among them), the registered codes and installed skills under
`skills/`, the trace store `mlflow.db`, and the session's outputs, with a line on what each
is. The agent may print the tree through a command; the reply then summarizes it.

## Post-Conditions

1. Knowledge base contains `cryoppp` collection with repo code, docs, and appended papers.
2. `skills/aidrin/` is present (installed at init); the code registry includes the two CryoPPP codes (the STAR-to-CSV converter and the box-file generator), the metadata-derivation code, and the quality-scoring code.
3. Quality-scored CSV exists with tier distribution; `particles.csv` (merged) and `particles_curated.csv` (curated) exist with `trace_archive/` records for both operations.
4. `trace_archive/` holds an `aidrin` record, which is the check report, for each table the pipeline wrote: `micrograph_metadata.csv`, the scored CSV, `particles.csv`, and `particles_curated.csv`. The two reports on the particle tables show curation returned the outlier score to the selected set's value (~0.041 → ~0.029).
5. A datacard exists for the processed dataset.
6. `pipeline.sh` exists, saved by `reconstruct_pipeline`.
7. Code execution records in `trace_archive/` document the full provenance chain, including one record per check run, each naming the table it read.
8. MLflow traces (in the serverless `mlflow.db` store) capture token usage, latency, and full request/response history.
