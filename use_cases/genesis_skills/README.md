# DSAgt Demo: Genesis Skills for a Data-Curation Pipeline

> **Estimated time:** ~10 minutes (the data is tiny; the one external
> dependency is a shallow clone of the Genesis catalog from GitHub — needs
> network access to `github.com`).

An end-to-end **data-preparation** walkthrough that exercises the skill catalog
against the **Genesis** source (AI-ModCon on GitHub). The agent installs the
BASE-Data/ModCon Croissant validator from the catalog, grounds the
`datacard-generator` base skill every project carries in the dataset's domain
documents, then prepares and **datacards a finished dataset**.

The "finished product" is a small curated dataset — a CO2-methanation **catalyst
screen** (`dataset/catalyst_screening.csv`, 8 rows) — plus the domain docs that
describe how it was produced. Everything is tiny, so the whole thing runs in
seconds with no real instruments or HPC.

## Prerequisites

- DSAgt installed and an agent platform installed and
  **already authenticated**.
- Git, with network access to `github.com` (the Genesis catalog clones from
  `AI-ModCon/genesis-skills`).
- Embedding credentials are optional — `search_skills` uses semantic search
  when `EMBEDDING_*` is set and falls back to a keyword scorer otherwise.

## Setup

```bash
dsagt init
```

At the menu, name the project `genesis-skills`, pick your agent, and **uncheck `genesis`**
at the skill-sources checkbox — the walkthrough has the agent enable that catalog itself
in step 1. Then:

```bash
PROJ=~/dsagt-projects/genesis-skills
# The fixture data (catalyst_screening.csv and the domain docs) is in the
# repository, under this use case's data/ folder. The expected datacard stays
# out of the project: it is the reference you compare against afterwards.
mkdir -p "$PROJ/mock_data"
cp -r use_cases/genesis_skills/data/dataset use_cases/genesis_skills/data/domain "$PROJ/mock_data/"
# $PROJ/mock_data now holds dataset/ and domain/
dsagt start genesis-skills
```

## Execution

Paste each prompt into the agent (running inside the project), one at a time.
Confirmation checks are consolidated in **Post-Conditions** below.

### 1. Enable the Genesis source

```text
Enable the "genesis" skill source so we have the GENESIS / ModCon data-curation skills available. Then tell me how many skills it indexed.
```

**Expect:** `add_skill_source(source="genesis")` → a shallow clone from GitHub,
its skills indexed, source written to `.dsagt/config.yaml`.

### 2. Find and install the validator skill

```text
Search the catalog for a skill that validates Croissant / JSON-LD dataset metadata and install the best match into this project.
```

**Expect:** `search_skills` surfaces **`croissant-validator`** → `install_skill`.
It is installed into `<project>/skills/` and mirrored into the agent's native
skills directory at install time, with a `PROVENANCE.txt` crediting the Genesis
source. `datacard-generator` needs no install: it is a base skill, present
since init.

### 3. Generate the datacard for the finished dataset

```text
Use the datacard-generator skill to write a Level 1 datacard for mock_data/dataset/catalyst_screening.csv. Pull the field definitions, measurement methodology, provenance, and license from the data dictionary and measurement protocol under mock_data/domain/ — don't invent them, and note anything the documents leave unspecified rather than asking. Include basic statistics for the numeric columns. Save it to audit/catalyst_screening_datacard.md.
```

**Expect:** the agent reads the installed skill's `SKILL.md` and the two domain
documents (reactor conditions **250 °C, 1 atm, H2:CO2 = 4:1, GHSV 12,000**;
license **CC-BY-4.0**), computes basic statistics from the 8-row CSV (row count,
uniqueness, missing values, and the range of each numeric column), and writes
`audit/catalyst_screening_datacard.md` covering summary / provenance / schema /
methodology / statistics / limitations / license. Required fields the documents
leave unspecified (contact, creator) carry a placeholder such as "unspecified".

### 4. Validate the metadata

```text
Use the croissant-validator skill to check the Croissant/JSON-LD metadata for this dataset (generate it from the datacard if needed), and report any schema errors.
```

**Expect:** the validator skill runs and reports a clean pass or names specific
schema issues. The generator script requires a `creator` and a `url`; the domain
documents state neither, so the correct values are placeholders such as
"unspecified", and an invented name or address is a failure. The library check
needs `mlcroissant`: the skill installs it into a small virtual environment, or
the agent registers the validator script as a code with `mlcroissant` as a
dependency and `dsagt-run` supplies it. A pass is one whose output shows
`mlcroissant parse OK`, since the script skips that check when the library is
absent.

### 5. Review the project artifacts

```text
Show me the contents of my project folder in a tree format, with the artifacts dsagt recorded during this session highlighted. Include the registered codes and installed skills.
```

**Expect:** a listing of the whole project directory, including the registered codes and
installed skills under `skills/`, with a line on what each entry is. The listing marks the
execution records in `trace_archive/`, the datacard and the validation output in `audit/`,
the trace store `mlflow.db`, and the session's other outputs.

## Post-Conditions

Confirm from a shell (the native skills directory is `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code,
`.agents/skills/` for Codex, Goose, and opencode, `.cline/skills/` for Cline):

```bash
dsagt info genesis-skills                  # KB lists skills_catalog__ai-modcon-genesis-skills
ls "$PROJ/skills/"                         # aidrin  croissant-validator  datacard-generator  skill-creator
cat "$PROJ/skills/croissant-validator/PROVENANCE.txt"
ls "$PROJ/audit/"                          # includes catalyst_screening_datacard.md
CARD="$PROJ/audit/catalyst_screening_datacard.md"
for value in '250 °C' 'GHSV' 'CC-BY-4.0' 'Single-run' 'C2+' 'relative'; do
    printf '%s: ' "$value"; grep -c -F -- "$value" "$CARD"   # each count is at least 1
done
ls "$PROJ/trace_archive" | wc -l           # at least 3
```

1. The KB holds a `skills_catalog__ai-modcon-genesis-skills` collection
   (searchable via `search_skills`).
2. `croissant-validator` is installed into `<project>/skills/` and mirrored
   into the agent's native skills directory, with a `PROVENANCE.txt` crediting
   the Genesis source; `datacard-generator` has been there since init as a
   base skill. The next session auto-invokes them natively; this session used
   them by reading their `SKILL.md`.
3. `audit/catalyst_screening_datacard.md` was produced for the finished dataset,
   grounded in the domain documents, and carries the values listed in
   `use_cases/genesis_skills/data/expected_datacard.md`: reactor conditions
   250 °C, 1 atm, H2:CO2 = 4:1, GHSV 12,000; license CC-BY-4.0; 8 rows; the
   ranges of the numeric columns; and the three caveats the measurement
   protocol states (single-run, trace C2+ excluded, relative ranking). Each
   `grep -c` above is at least 1. Section headings follow the Genesis template,
   which names them differently from the expected file.
4. The validator's output shows `mlcroissant parse OK`.
5. `trace_archive/` holds at least three execution records: the datacard
   introspection, the datacard validation, and the Croissant validation, each
   run through `dsagt-run`.
6. MLflow traces (in the serverless `mlflow.db` store) capture the session —
   `dsagt traces genesis-skills`.

## What This Tests

| DSAgt Capability | Steps |
|------------------|-------|
| Enabling an external skill source in-session (`add_skill_source`) | 1 |
| Catalog search and install (`search_skills`, `install_skill`) | 2 |
| Native mirroring of installed skills | 2 |
| Base-skill use (`datacard-generator`) | 3 |
| Installed-skill execution grounded in the domain documents | 3, 4 |
| Review of the session's artifacts | 5 |

## Cleanup

```bash
dsagt rm genesis-skills -y
```

The shared catalog cache is stored at `~/dsagt-projects/.skill_sources/` and is
reused across projects; delete it to force a fresh clone.
