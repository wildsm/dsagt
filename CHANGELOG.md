# Changelog

All notable changes to DSAgt are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **A run ended by a signal is recorded.** A run ended by SIGTERM, SIGINT, or
  SIGHUP still writes its record with the signal's status.
- **File hashes in every record.** `execution.file_hashes` holds the SHA-256
  of each input before the run and each output after it. When a spec has no
  parameter roles, an argument that is an existing
  file is an input and one that exists only after the run is an output.
- **`readiness_reports` tool.** The AI-readiness reports on record for a
  file, newest first, each with whether the file is unchanged since that
  run; the readiness paragraph says to call it before a check, so an
  unchanged file is checked once, and defines a table (CSV, Parquet, Excel,
  JSON records; HDF5 or NumPy only once `aidrin summarize` shows one table).
- **`reconstruct_pipeline(output=...)`** saves the script under the project;
  the bash script creates the recorded output directories first and removes
  a repeated output before the step that rewrites it.
- **One install path for every skill.** `skills.register_skill_scripts`
  registers each `scripts/*.py` and `*.sh` of an installed skill as a code
  (spec from the overrides table or the script's argparse calls) and
  rewrites the skill's bare invocations to the stored `dsagt-run` line;
  `dsagt init`, `install_skill`, and `save_skill` call it and reply with the
  stored lines.
- **`kb_list_collections` and `kb_search(where=...)`.** Every collection is
  listed with its purpose, its metadata keys, and its chunk count, dsagt's
  own (`codes`, `code_use`, `session_memory`, `explicit_memory`) before their
  first write; `kb_search` takes a metadata filter.
- **The MCP env block carries the launching shell's activated environment**
  (`PATH`, `VIRTUAL_ENV`, `CONDA_PREFIX`, `PYTHONPATH`, the library paths,
  the `module` variables, plus `mcp.env_passthrough` from the config), copied
  at `dsagt init` and `dsagt start`; a credential name is refused.
- **Shared tracking server.** `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` in the shell redirects all
  self-logging — CLI, MCP server, `dsagt-run` — to a remote MLflow server
  instead of the project's sqlite file; `MLFLOW_TRACKING_API_KEY` authenticates
  to an `X-API-Key` gateway in front of it. `dsagt traces` and `dsagt info`
  follow the same resolution. Keys an agent cannot pass to its MCP children
  (codex, cline) are read from `~/.config/dsagt/env` at startup.
- **Experiment naming for shared servers.** Traces log to an experiment named
  `dsagt-<8 hex>` (hashed from the project directory) rather than the bare
  project name, so two users' `demo` projects do not collide; `mlflow.experiment`
  in `.dsagt/config.yaml` overrides it. The experiment carries the description
  "DSAgt (DataSmith Agent) AI-assisted data pipeline builder — project: <name>"
  and a `dsagt.project` tag, both set once on creation.

### Changed

- **`dsagt-run` adds about 0.2 s to a command, down from 1.3 to 2 s.** The
  run loads no trace store. It writes the record, then starts a detached
  process that logs the `code.execute` trace from the record with the run's
  start and end times; writers take a lock on `.dsagt/run_trace.lock`, and
  an error goes to `.dsagt/run_trace.log`.
- **Codes and skills share `skills/`.** A code is a skill directory whose
  frontmatter declares an executable; a project has no `codes/` directory,
  and `dsagt init` on a project with one moves each code under `skills/`.
- **The native skills mirror is a relative symlink per skill directory**, so
  the agent reads the live files; a skill whose description exceeds Claude
  Code's cap is copied with the description truncated.
- **A skill source is fetched as a GitHub tarball** over HTTPS (the shell's
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` when present); the user's git is the fallback for a
  repository the API refuses and for a URL that is not GitHub.
- **Trace acknowledgements are keyed by transcript**, so a resumed
  conversation (`claude --continue`, `codex exec resume`) logs only its new
  turns, and the final flush emits the last turn only once it holds a
  response.
- **Section 1 of the instructions** defines a pipeline step as a command
  that produces or transforms a dataset file, and says it runs as a
  registered code by its stored line. The foreground rule names a background
  subagent as forbidden beside a background task.
- `search_registry` lists hits by rank instead of a rank-fusion score.
- The startup catch-up reuses the server's knowledge base, so one embedder
  serves the session.

- AIDRIN has one path: the code registry. The `aidrin` package is a dependency
  of dsagt, so the CLI is in dsagt's Python environment; every `dsagt init`
  registers `aidrin` as a code, so each call the agent makes through it is an
  execution record; and the `aidrin` base skill is fetched at the release tag
  of the installed package, read when init runs. A cached skill source is
  re-cloned when the branch or tag it holds differs from the one asked for; a
  failed re-clone keeps the previous cache, and a set-aside clone a crashed
  sync left behind is never a source.
- `uv` is a dependency of dsagt: codes with declared Python dependencies run
  through `uv run --with` and `install_dependencies` installs through `uv pip`,
  so a `pip install` of dsagt is the whole install.
- `dsagt-run` appends the directory of its own interpreter to the command's
  PATH, so a CLI that is a dsagt dependency resolves under pipx or
  `uv tool install`, where only dsagt's own commands are linked onto PATH.
- Per-agent instructions files hold the dsagt text between
  `<!-- dsagt:begin -->` and `<!-- dsagt:end -->`; init and start replace that
  block and keep the user's text around it, so a changed readiness setting or
  an upgraded dsagt reaches the agent.
- The readiness gate is the AI-readiness check, on by default. `dsagt init`
  asks whether to assess tabular data before and after each data transform
  (`--no-readiness` declines); the answer adds one paragraph at the
  per-operation check rule of the instructions, making the check for a tabular
  stage the `aidrin` skill's quality baseline. The profile, the executable
  path, the shared install, the `--readiness` flag, and the appended
  instructions block are gone.
- `datacard-generator` is a base skill: every `dsagt init` installs it from the
  genesis catalog (`skills/basedata-skills/`) alongside `skill-creator` and
  `aidrin`, so the agent invokes it natively without a catalog search.
- Base skills install from the shared source cache after the knowledge base
  is provisioned, one skill at a time: each skill's codes are registered and
  indexed into the `codes` collection before the next skill starts, and a
  skill whose fetch fails is reported without blocking the others. A skill
  already in the project is kept as it is; deleting its directory and
  re-running init restores the upstream copy. A source is cloned once, on the
  first init that needs it, and reused as is by every later init;
  `add_skill_source` with `force` re-clones it on request. An init with a
  warm cache needs no network.

### Removed

- **`scan-directory`** and the bundled-code layer (`src/dsagt/codes/`,
  `CodeRegistry.ensure_bundled_copies`). The base skills' codes are the
  examples.
- **`run_command`, `read_file`, `http_request`.** Execution in the user's
  environment is `dsagt-run`'s, from the agent's shell; reads are the
  agent's own tools. The server has 18 tools.

### Fixed

- **A second `save_skill` keeps the spec the agent saved.** The argparse-derived
  spec replaced one that `save_code_spec` had given dependencies or roles;
  it is now written only when the code does not exist, and `save_code_spec`
  rewrites the owning skill's usage lines to the stored command. A file a
  command moved away is an input, not an output.
- **Records.** With no declared file parameters, an argument the run changed
  is an output (a converter's second run named none). A failed run lists only
  the outputs that exist. The reconstructed pipeline script keeps the
  finished children of a loop script that was killed.
- **Concurrent `dsagt init` runs no longer erase the project registry.** A
  run that read `~/dsagt-projects/projects.yaml` while another was writing it
  found an empty file and saved only its own project. The registry is
  changed under a lock and replaced in one step.
- Tool arguments and results recorded on a trace are bounded before they
  reach the store, with credential-bearing keys (`headers`, `api_key`,
  `token`, …) redacted and common credential shapes inside strings (`Bearer …`,
  `?api_key=…`) masked; an `http_request` bearer token or a whole `read_file`
  payload was previously written verbatim into `mlflow.db`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-11

### Changed

- DSAgt holds no skills of its own. `dsagt init` installs two base skills into
  `<project>/skills/` from the repositories that maintain them, re-cloning each
  so the copy matches upstream: `skill-creator` from the genesis catalog
  (`skills/basedata-skills/`) and `aidrin` from `idtlab/AIDRIN`. The `aidrin`
  skill-catalog source is gone (it held that one skill), and so is the built-in
  `aidrin` gate code: the readiness gate instructs the agent to run the
  profile's metrics through the `aidrin` skill's CLI.
- The `genesis` skill source is `github.com/AI-ModCon/genesis-skills`.
- Intel Macs are no longer a supported platform. The `darwin/x86_64` entry in
  `required-environments` held every environment on torch 2.2.2 and NumPy 1.x;
  the lock now resolves torch 2.14, NumPy 2.x, transformers 5.x,
  sentence-transformers 6.x, and tree-sitter-language-pack 1.16. `torch>=2.3`
  is a declared dependency, so an install on an Intel Mac fails at dependency
  resolution with a message naming torch. Without the floor, a fresh install
  there produced torch 2.2.2 beside NumPy 2 and the knowledge-base build
  failed at import.
- `requires-python` is `>=3.12` again; CI tests 3.12 and 3.13.
- Dependencies are declared as ranges with a next-major cap, so dsagt
  resolves beside a project that pins differently. `ruyaml`, which nothing
  imported, is removed.

### Fixed

- The MCP server copied every collection in the shared `kb_index/` into the
  project at startup, so a skill catalog excluded at `dsagt init` still
  appeared as synced. The server now only opens the project's own `kb_index`;
  `dsagt init` is the one place collections are provisioned.
- `run_command` accepted its `command` as one argv element, so a code spec's
  multi-word executable (`dsagt-run --code x -- python ...`) failed with
  "not found". The string is now split like a shell would.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-08

A large release. It adds an **external skill-catalog system**, consolidates the
agent-facing surface into a **single `dsagt-server`**, recovers **observability
and episodic memory without a proxy** — both read from each agent's own on-disk
transcript rather than intercepted LLM traffic — renames registered executables
to **codes**, and makes codes and skills natively discoverable as soon as they
are added to a project.

Agents discover and install skills from federated GitHub/GitLab catalogs
(Genesis, Anthropic, K-Dense, and more) and author their own; installed skills
are picked up through each agent's *native* `SKILL.md` auto-discovery, so
`search_skills` is reserved for the one job native discovery can't do: browsing
the corpus of skills you haven't installed yet. In parallel, the registry and
knowledge MCP servers — two processes that each loaded their own embedder and
opened their own ChromaDB — collapse into one `dsagt-server`: one embedder, one
Chroma owner, one connection per agent.

**Upgrading from 0.1.0.** There is no automatic migration — adopting 0.2.0 is
rebuild-not-migrate, and no project data changes:
- Re-run `dsagt start <project>` for each existing project; it regenerates the
  per-agent MCP config to point at the single `dsagt-server`.
- For **cline** only, delete `<project>/.cline-data` first — `cline mcp add`
  has no remove, so the stale `dsagt-registry`/`dsagt-knowledge` entries would
  otherwise linger next to the new one.
- Codes, skills, the KB index, traces, and memory all carry over untouched.

### Added
- **Proxy-free trace pipeline.** An in-session heartbeat in `dsagt-server`
  reads the agent's transcript and logs prompts, responses, tool calls, and
  token usage to the serverless MLflow store — every supported agent (claude,
  codex, goose, opencode, cline); no proxy, no OTel routing, no credentials.
  DSAgt's own spans flow to the same store, tagged `dsagt.source` so the debug
  view filters apart from agent traces.
- **`dsagt traces <project>`** opens the MLflow viewer over the project's
  store: runs trace catch-up first, deep-links to the Traces tab, and
  suppresses MLflow's console noise.
- **Episodic memory (opt-in).** `dsagt init --episodic`: the heartbeat
  mechanically chunks, keyword-tags, and embeds each completed turn into
  `session_memory` (no LLM); retrieval is recency-weighted
  (`episodic.recency_half_life_days`, default 14).
- **External skill catalogs**: discover and install agent skills from GitHub /
  GitLab sources via `add_skill_source`, `search_skills`, and `install_skill`
  (plus the `dsagt skills sync/add/list/search` CLI), backed by per-source
  ChromaDB collections. Curated sources are provided out of the box
  (`k-dense-ai`, `anthropic`, `antigravity`, `composio`, `genesis`); any git URL
  / `owner/repo` also works.
- **Genesis catalog integration**: the curated `genesis` source (OSTI GitLab,
  `gitlab.osti.gov/genesis/genesis-skills`) makes the BASE-Data / ModCon skills
  — `datacard-generator` (frontmatter name `generating-datacards`),
  `croissant-validator`, `hdmf-schema-builder` — pullable on demand
  (`dsagt skills add <project> genesis`, then `install_skill`) rather than
  built into the package, alongside the rest of the Genesis catalog (HPC/Slurm,
  HuggingFace, LangChain, and more).
- **Immediate native discovery.** Installing or creating a skill, or
  registering a code, mirrors it into each agent's native skills directory
  (`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, …) right away and re-mirrors at
  `dsagt init` / `start`, so every supported agent auto-discovers it with no
  restart.
- **`skill-creator`** built-in skill for authoring new skills from the Anthropic
  template.
- **Source-qualified catalog install**: when the same skill name exists in more
  than one synced source, install a specific one with a `<source-slug>/<skill>`
  name (via `install_skill` or `dsagt skills add <project> <slug>/<skill>`)
  instead of dead-ending on the ambiguity guard.
- **Keyword fallback** for `search_skills`: a zero-dependency token-overlap
  scorer so catalog search works even when no embedding model is configured.
- **License / attribution provenance on install**: installing a catalog skill
  preserves upstream `LICENSE` / `NOTICE` files and stamps a `PROVENANCE.txt`
  recording the source repo and path into the installed skill directory.
- **New use cases**: `isaac_skills_demo` — an end-to-end, skill-oriented
  walkthrough that drives a real agent through syncing a catalog, installing a
  skill, and converting mock VASP output into an Isaac record (prompts + mock
  data included) — plus tokamak-stability and AIDRIN data-readiness walkthroughs.
- **Install-from-GitHub instructions** for non-developers (`pip install
  git+https://github.com/AI-ModCon/dsagt.git` into any Python 3.12/3.13
  environment) in the README and docs.

### Changed
- **The two MCP servers are now one `dsagt-server`** — one shared
  `KnowledgeBase`/embedder, one MCP entry per agent, one trace `service.name`.
  The tool surface is organized by concern (registry / knowledge / memory /
  skill) behind the single server.
- **"Tools" are now "codes."** Registered CLI executables are *codes*
  throughout — `<project>/codes/`, `save_code_spec`, `dsagt-run --code`, the
  `code_use` collection, `code.execute` spans — reserving "tool" for the
  MCP/agent sense.
- **Codes share the skill envelope.** A code is a skill-standard dir
  (`codes/<name>/SKILL.md`); built-in codes are copied into `<project>/codes/`
  at init — one place, one format.
- **Skill discovery is catalog-only**: installed and built-in skills are
  discovered natively by every supported agent, so `search_skills` covers only
  the not-yet-installed external catalog. Catalogs are indexed on frontmatter
  (name + description + tags) rather than the full SKILL.md body.
- **Agents are pre-authenticated.** DSAgt never touches provider credentials;
  all credential-hint machinery is gone.
- **Code-use indexing is incremental.** `dsagt-run` records embed into
  `code_use` on the heartbeat and on demand before `reconstruct_pipeline`,
  instead of waiting for the next session's startup catch-up.
- **Blocking tool work runs off the event loop.** `run_command`, dependency
  installs, registry search, and pipeline reconstruction execute in worker
  threads, so a long call no longer stalls the trace heartbeat or concurrent
  tools.
- Scientific KB collections (`nemo_curator`, `aidrin`) index documentation and
  papers only, not library source — faster first-run ingestion; source is
  better served by the agent's own file search than by vector retrieval.
- `search_skills` reports when no external catalog is synced instead of a bare
  "no match", and `list_skill_sources` flags each known source as
  `synced`/available with its indexed count.
- The package version is single-sourced from `dsagt.__version__` (pyproject
  reads it via setuptools dynamic metadata).
- Documentation home page (`docs/index.md`) pulls the supported-agents table
  and install instructions directly from the README via the
  `mkdocs-include-markdown` plugin, so the two no longer drift.

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** the `dsagt-registry-server` and `dsagt-knowledge-server` console
  scripts, replaced by `dsagt-server` (see **Upgrading** above).
- The episodic **LLM-judge** distillation layer and **outlier-suggestion**
  feature (incl. the `kb_get_suggestions` / `kb_dismiss_suggestion` MCP tools
  and the `llama-cpp-python` dependency), plus their `dsagt init` prompts and
  config keys. Episodic memory keeps the mechanical capture path so a Tier-0
  baseline can be measured first.
- The built-in `datacard-generator` skill — it lives in the Genesis catalog and
  is now installed on demand via `dsagt skills add <project> genesis`.
- Dead indexing of installed/built-in skills into the `skills` ChromaDB
  collection (nothing read it after the catalog-only search change).
- Dead `provenance.index_execution_record`.

### Fixed
- **`dsagt init` on an existing project** no longer crashes with a raw
  traceback — it referenced an embedding-choice config key the init menu no
  longer produces.
- **A KB misconfig no longer takes down the server.** An `api` embedding
  backend without its base URL or key now degrades only the KB-backed tools;
  the rest of the surface starts normally (previously every tool was lost).
- **One malformed line no longer stalls a whole pipeline.** A corrupt
  transcript line, trace record, or ack file is skipped rather than aborting
  the session's trace, episodic-memory, and code-use indexing on every
  heartbeat.
- **A code run outside a session indexes correctly** — a `dsagt-run` command
  executed by hand records a null session id that no longer poisons the
  `code_use` batch.
- **Switching away from goose** removes the stale `goose.yaml` MCP config
  instead of leaving it behind.
- **Registry and skill listing/search tolerate incomplete specs** — a code
  spec missing `description`, non-dict frontmatter, and substring tag matches
  no longer crash or mis-filter results.
- **Duplicate `code_use` entries** — indexing is now idempotent against a
  persisted ack set shared by the heartbeat and startup catch-up.
- **CLI-added skill sources** are now persisted to the project config.
- **`dsagt --version`** now works (it was documented but unimplemented —
  argparse errored). Reports the version from `dsagt.__version__`.
- **Catalog skills with technically-invalid YAML frontmatter** (e.g. an
  unquoted `description` containing a colon, like `…readiness levels: Level
  1…`) are no longer silently dropped from discovery. `_parse_frontmatter`
  falls back to a lenient flat parse that recovers `name`/`description`/`tags`.
- **cline:** per-project MCP config via `CLINE_MCP_SETTINGS_PATH`; `cline mcp
  add` works on cline 3.x; global auth and settings are never touched.
- **codex:** the trace reader follows the per-project `CODEX_HOME`.

### Security
- **Skill-install path traversal.** A catalog skill whose frontmatter `name`
  was `..`, absolute, or nested could escape `<project>/skills/` and
  delete/overwrite files elsewhere on `install_skill`; the name must now be a
  single path component.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- Initial release: registry and knowledge MCP servers, BYOA per-agent config
  generation, MLflow/OTel observability, the tool/skill registry, execution
  provenance, and explicit + episodic memory.
