# Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is DSAgt's catalog of **domain knowledge** — reference corpora and your own documents — that the agent searches to ground its work on scientific data-processing and AI-readiness evaluation.

## Domain-knowledge collections

| Collection | Source | Populated by |
|---|---|---|
| **Reference corpus** | NeMo Curator (data-curation references) | `dsagt init` (chosen collections) |
| **Your documents** | Papers, standards, protocols, schemas you ingest | Agent's `kb_ingest` |

The agent has five knowledge base tools: `kb_ingest` (index a folder into a named collection; the ingest runs in the background), `kb_append` (add documents to an existing collection), `kb_job_status` (poll a background job), `kb_search` (retrieve across one or more collections, with a `where` metadata filter and regex or substring filters over the chunk text), and `kb_list_collections` (every collection with its purpose, the metadata keys a `where` filter takes, and its chunk count).

## Hybrid vector search

Retrieval is hybrid, dense semantic embeddings fused with sparse BM25 keyword matching, per collection by default:

- **Semantic embeddings** match paraphrase and synonymy: a query about "missing values" finds a passage on "null rates" with no shared words.
- **BM25 keyword matching** matches the exact terms embeddings under-rank (identifiers, gene names, parameter flags, standard names), where a literal match matters.
- **Per-collection partitioning** scopes a search to a domain, so a materials-science query is ranked against materials references only.

The default embedder is `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` run locally on onnxruntime from the ONNX export the model's repository publishes (133 MB, downloaded once).

## Shared vector store

The same vector store also holds DSAgt's [memory](memory.md) (explicit and episodic), the [skill corpus](skills.md), and the [execution records](provenance.md) (the `code_use` collection). Each is a separate collection in that store, sharing one embedder and one ChromaDB; the linked pages describe each collection.

## Setup

`dsagt init` sets up the knowledge base from your choices in the interactive menu.

## Try it

```bash
dsagt init            # name it `demo`, and check `nemo_curator` at the knowledge-collections menu
dsagt start demo
```

Then, in the agent — substituting `<your-docs-folder>` with any folder of your
own documents (papers, protocols, schemas):

1. > Ingest the docs in `<your-docs-folder>` into a collection named `domain`.
2. > Search the `domain` and `nemo_curator` collections for how to assess data quality.
