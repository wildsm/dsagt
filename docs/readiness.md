# AI-Readiness Check

DSAgt is configured at init to run [AIDRIN](https://github.com/idtlab/AIDRIN) (AI Data Readiness Inspector) as the check before and after every tabular pipeline stage; uncheck it on the menu to turn it off. AIDRIN installs with dsagt, and every project gets the `aidrin` skill and an `aidrin` code, so each call the agent makes is an execution record in `trace_archive/` like any other code. A user who asks "is my data AI-ready?" gets the AIDRIN skill's workflow.

The DSAgt instructions request assessments for the effects of data transformations for the downstream application, with reports in `audit/`. For tabular files that check is the `aidrin` skill's quality baseline (completeness, duplicity, outliers), run on the stage's input before the operation and on its output after it. Every stage is measured the same way, so the before/after delta is comparable across stages and projects.

`dsagt init` asks "Assess tabular data for AI-readiness before and after each data transform?", default yes; when it is yes, the agent's instructions carry one paragraph at the per-operation check rule; when it is no, they do not. The `aidrin` code and skill are present either way.

The inserted paragraph:

> #### AI-readiness check
>
> For a stage whose input or output is a tabular file (CSV, TSV, Excel, JSON,
> HDF5, Parquet, npz), the check is the `aidrin` skill's quality baseline: run
> it on the file before and after the operation, through the registered
> `aidrin` code's `executable` (never bare `aidrin`). Run the baseline
> directly; do not ask the user about intent or confirm a plan for these checks
> (the skill's full workflow is for assessments the user asks for). A JSON,
> HDF5, or NumPy file may hold nested or multi-dataset structure that the
> baseline reads as one flat table; say so beside the numbers when you report
> them. The run's execution record holds the report, and `readiness_reports`
> returns the one on record for a file; `dsagt-run` refuses a check that
> repeats one already on record for the file's current content. Report the
> per-metric change to the user before proposing the next step, comparing a
> table with its own earlier report or with the report of the table it was made
> from. Do not write a custom check for a metric AIDRIN provides. A stage with
> a tabular input or output gets this check; every other stage keeps the check
> rule above.
## Try it

A three-stage pipeline on AIDRIN's own demo dataset: 525 sensor readings with 25 exact
duplicates, missing values in every sensor column, and temperature outliers. About ten minutes;
the only download is a 40 KB CSV.

```bash
dsagt init
```

At the menu, name the project `assessment-demo`, pick your agent, leave the knowledge
collections and skill sources unchecked (the check needs neither), and keep the
AI-readiness check on. Then:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/dsagt-projects/assessment-demo/data
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idtlab/AIDRIN/develop/demos/messy_sensor_data.csv \
    -o ~/dsagt-projects/assessment-demo/data/sensors.csv
dsagt start assessment-demo
```

Then one prompt. Leave AIDRIN and checks out of it; the demo shows what the agent does unprompted:

```text
Build a curation pipeline for data/sensors.csv in three steps, one at a time:
1. drop exact duplicate rows -> data/dedup.csv
2. drop rows with a missing temperature -> data/complete.csv
3. drop rows whose temperature is more than 3 standard deviations from the mean -> data/clean.csv
Confirm the approach with me before each step.
```

At each stage the agent should run the AIDRIN quality baseline on the stage input before the
operation and on the output after it, write both reports to `audit/`, and show the metric delta
before proposing the next step. Expected values on this dataset (pre column measured directly):

| Stage | Metric | pre | post |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 dedup | duplicity | 0.0476 | 0.0 |
| 2 complete | completeness (`temperature`) | 0.8457 | 1.0 |
| 3 outliers | outliers (`temperature`) | 0.0225 | lower |

Afterwards, one more prompt:

```text
Show me the execution records for this session as a table of step, command, and exit code.
```

The table lists one record per baseline run (two per stage) and one per operation, and
`audit/` holds the six reports. Clean up with `dsagt rm assessment-demo -y`.

## Demos

The [cryo-EM curation demo](use-cases/cryoem.md) runs on real scientific data; the check measures the particle-curation step unprompted. The [AIDRIN example](use-cases/aidrin-ai-readiness.md) drives quality, fairness, and privacy metrics on a tabular dataset.
