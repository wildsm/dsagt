# Provenance

DSAgt records data operations as reproducible, auditable steps. The agent registers a **code** — a CLI executable — and every run of that code is wrapped for provenance capture, so the pipeline can later be reconstructed from the record.

## Codes

Registered codes are CLI executables defined as skills. The agent registers new codes via the MCP server's `save_code_spec` tool and finds existing ones via `search_registry`.

A code spec includes:

- A YAML frontmatter block describing the executable, parameters, dependencies, and tags.
- A markdown body with the exact runnable command, usage, and notes for the agent.

Example code spec (`skills/csv-summary/SKILL.md`):

```markdown
---
name: csv-summary
description: Summarize a CSV — columns, row count, null counts, numeric stats. Use when profiling a tabular dataset.
executable: dsagt-run --code csv-summary -- python skills/csv-summary/scripts/csv_summary.py
parameters:
  file:
    type: string
    required: true
    cli: positional
    description: Path to the CSV file
dependencies: []
tags: [csv, profiling]
---

Run this registered code with the exact shell command below…
```

DSAgt wraps every registered code with `dsagt-run` for provenance capture and `uv run --with` for Python dependencies, so the agent can call any code without managing environments manually. The base skills' scripts and the `aidrin` CLI are registered as codes at `dsagt init`, indexed for search.

## Execution record

Every registered code runs through the `dsagt-run` wrapper. For each call it records the command, arguments, exit code, duration, input and output files, and truncated stderr to `<project>/trace_archive/<record_id>.json`, and, once the command has exited, a detached `python -m dsagt.commands.log_trace` process logs a `code.execute` span with the run's own start and end times to the [trace store](observability.md), so the wrapper adds about 0.2 s to a command. An error from that process is appended to `.dsagt/run_trace.log`. The MCP server incrementally indexes those records into the `code_use` collection, so past executions are searchable.

The wrapper is the point of code-mediated data access. A direct shell or editor call isn't recordless — the agent's transcript still captures whatever it chose to report about the command and its stdout/stderr — but that's a partial, agent-curated account, not the structured `dsagt-run` record of exit code, timing, and input/output files. Only the wrapped record carries what `reconstruct_pipeline` needs, so a direct call still breaks reconstruction.

## Pipeline reconstruction

The on-disk execution records are the canonical provenance chain. The agent calls `reconstruct_pipeline` to render the trace archive as a reproducible **bash script** (`format="bash"`) or **Snakemake workflow** (`format="snakemake"`). It flushes the latest records into the searchable index first, then lists the steps in the order they ran, each annotated with its input and output files and the steps it depends on; a run that exited non-zero is kept as a comment, and paths under the project are written relative to it. The files come from the spec's parameter roles (`role: input` or `role: output` on a parameter), which `dsagt-run` reads off the command line on every run; `--input-files` and `--output-files` override them.

## Try it

```bash
export SMOKE_DIR="$(pwd)/tests/smoke_test"   # a small built-in sample script + CSV
dsagt init            # follow the prompts: name it `demo`, then pick your agent
dsagt start demo      # launch the agent in the project
```

Then, in the agent (replace `$SMOKE_DIR` with the absolute path you exported):

1. > Register the CLI utility at `$SMOKE_DIR/csv_summary.py` as a code named `csv-summary`.
2. > Run the `csv-summary` code from the registry on `$SMOKE_DIR/data/samples.csv` and summarize the columns.
3. > Reconstruct the pipeline as a bash script.

Afterwards, inspect the trail:

```bash
ls ~/dsagt-projects/demo/{codes,trace_archive}          # the specs + execution records
dsagt traces demo                                        # code.execute spans in the MLflow viewer
```
