"""MCP tools for skill discovery, install, and catalog sources.

The full skill surface of ``dsagt-server``, consolidated from the two former
servers: register a project skill (``save_skill``), enable + list external
catalog sources (``add_skill_source`` / ``list_skill_sources``), search the
catalog (``search_skills``), and install a catalog skill into the project
(``install_skill``).  The catalog data plane + router live in
:mod:`dsagt.skills`; these handlers are the thin MCP wiring over it.

Installed/created skills are natively auto-discovered by every supported agent,
so ``search_skills`` covers only the not-yet-installed *catalog* tier (plus the
no-embedder keyword fallback).

These definitions + handlers run inside the merged ``dsagt-server`` (see
:mod:`dsagt.mcp.server`); ``create_skill_server`` is retained only as a
test-facing constructor.
