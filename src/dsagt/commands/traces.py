"""
dsagt traces <project>: open the MLflow trace viewer over the project's
store.

Three additions over a raw
``mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///<pdir>/mlflow.db``:

1. Catch-up first.  Runs :func:`dsagt.session.catch_up_extraction`, which
   writes the most recent session's deferred final turn (the one an
   ungraceful agent exit leaves unlogged) into the store before the viewer
   opens, so the last query is present.
2. A deep link to the Traces tab.  DSAGT writes MLflow traces, and the
   default Experiments/Runs view lists runs, so it is empty.  The project's
   experiment id is resolved and the printed URL opens its Traces tab.
3. Quiet.  ``--workers 1`` and ``PYTHONWARNINGS=ignore`` drop the repeated
   Starlette deprecation warnings; the viewer runs in the foreground (Ctrl-C
   to stop).
