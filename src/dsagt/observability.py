"""
DSAgt observability — first-party span emission over the serverless MLflow store.

DSAGT writes every trace to one ``sqlite:///<pdir>/mlflow.db`` store (no server).
TWO emission paths share that one store; they differ because MLflow's API forces
it, not by accident:

  * LIVE tracer (``mlflow.start_span``) — first-party DSAGT spans emitted *as the
    MCP server / dsagt-run runs*.  Uses MLflow's active-span context for
    auto-nesting and the ``obs`` proxy.  Each trace's root is tagged
    ``dsagt.source`` with the MCP tool *category* the agent invoked
    (memory / skill / knowledge / registry), or ``execution`` for dsagt-run —
    set at the dispatch boundary, so the UI can filter this *debugging* view
    apart from agent traces and bucket it by concern.
  * REPLAY sink (``MLflowSink`` → ``mlflow.start_span_no_context``) — a finished
    agent ``traces.Trace`` backfilled after the fact with the transcript's
    original timestamps.  ``start_span`` cannot backdate (it has no
    ``start_time_ns`` param), so replay *must* use ``start_span_no_context``;
    live *should* use ``start_span`` (no_context establishes no active span,
    which would kill the ``obs`` proxy and auto-nesting).  Hence two paths, one
    store.

    ``tool_<name>`` children.  Agent traces carry no ``dsagt.source`` tag, so
    they stay in the normal view, separate from the internal debug traces.

    A session ``Trace`` carries one AGENT subtree per turn; the sink emits **one
    MLflow trace per AGENT root**, matching the per-prompt granularity autolog's
